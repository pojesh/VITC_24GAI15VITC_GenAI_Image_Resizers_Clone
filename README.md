# VITC_24GAI15VITC_GenAI_Image_Resizers

This project provides a powerful service for advanced image manipulation, featuring two core functionalities: high-fidelity image upscaling using **Real-ESRGAN** and intelligent image outpainting with a **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) pipeline**.

The application is built with FastAPI, providing a robust and easy-to-use API for frontend applications.

## 🤖 Model Descriptions

This project leverages two state-of-the-art AI models for image processing.

### Image Upscaling: Real-ESRGAN

* **Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN)** is used for restoring and upscaling low-resolution images.
* It excels at handling real-world images with complex degradations.
* We utilize two pre-trained models:
    * `RealESRGAN_x4plus`: For upscaling images by a factor of 4.
    * `RealESRGAN_x2plus`: For upscaling images by a factor of 2.

### Image Outpainting: SDXL ControlNet Union

* **Image Outpainting** (or canvas extension) is achieved using a powerful **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** pipeline. This technique intelligently generates new pixels to expand an image beyond its original boundaries, creating a larger, coherent picture.

* The pipeline is composed of several key components working in unison:
    * **Base Model (`SG161222/RealVisXL_V5.0_Lightning`):** This is the core generative model responsible for creating the image content. It's a "lightning" version, optimized for speed and efficiency without significant loss of quality.
    * **VAE (`madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix`):** The Variational Autoencoder translates the image into a latent space where the model can work and then decodes it back into a viewable image. This specific VAE is optimized for FP16 precision, preventing common artifacts and ensuring high-quality output.
    * **ControlNet (`xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0`):** This is the crucial component for outpainting. It conditions the generation process on the original image, ensuring that the newly generated pixels are contextually aware and blend seamlessly with the existing content, maintaining consistency in style, lighting, and subject matter.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation
Refer to (`run-notes.txt`) in the root directory.
To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.ecodesamsung.com/SRIB-PRISM/VITC_24GAI15VITC_GenAI_Image_Resizers.git
    cd VITC_24GAI15VITC_GenAI_Image_Resizers
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for backend:**
    ```bash
    cd ImageResizer-Server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download Model Weights:**
    The Real-ESRGAN model weights already exist in 
    ```bash
    ImageResizer-Server\
    |── Real-ESRGAN-master\
    |   └── weights\
    |       ├── RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth
    |       └── RealESRGAN_x2plus.pth

    ```

    *The SDXL and ControlNet models will be downloaded automatically from Hugging Face on the first run.*

---

### ▶️ Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can start the backend server.

1.  **Start the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    cd ImageResizer-Server
    python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

2.  **Start the Next.js server:**
    ```bash
    cd ImageResizer-Webapp
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

Note: 
* Restart the backend if cuda out-of-memory error occurs.
---

## 🐳 Docker

Run the application using docker.
* Windows requires WSL2 and Nvidia-Container-Toolkit installed to run the container.
* `.wslconfig` in User directory needs to be modified for more resource allocation.
    ```bash
    [wsl2]
    memory=8GB  
    processors=10 
    swap=8GB    
    ```

1.  **In the repository root directory:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
    * The models will be downloaded from HuggingFaceHub, it will take time to initiate on first run.
    * The docker terminal conflicts with tqdm progress bar, the bar won't show up.
    * Progress bar will not show up during outpaint process as well.
    * Real-ESRGAN model weights are included in the image, so ignore the warning if occurs.

2.  **For future runs if images gets updated in Docker Hub:**
    ```bash
    # Pull the latest versions of the images
    docker compose pull

    # Recreate the containers with the new images
    docker compose up --force-recreate
    ```

## 🖥️ Frontend Interface

Here's a screenshot of the web application interface:

![Frontend Screenshot](documents/images/prism_frontend_image.png)

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to:
- Upload images for processing
- Choose upscaling resolutions 2x and 4x
- Specify outpainting dimensions (width, height)
- View and download processed results

## ✨ Results Showcase

### Upscaling Results

Here is a comparison of an original image with its 2x and 4x upscaled versions.
